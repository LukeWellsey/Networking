# Overview

My goal for this project is to create a simple client-to-server communication service that will allow users on different computers to communicate. I'm planning to use a simple approach, with only capability to send and recieve messages. I'd like to work towards allowing users to communicate over different networks as an end goal.

{Provide a description the networking program that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  If you did Client/Server, then you will need to describe how to start both.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

{Describe the architecture that you used (client/server or peer-to-peer)}

{Identify if you are using TCP or UDP and what port numbers are used.}

{Identify the format of messages being sent between the client and server or the messages sent between two peers.}

# Development Environment

I used VScode and Python to develop this software, with these libraries:
