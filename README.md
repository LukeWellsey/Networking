# Overview

My goal for this project is to create a simple client-to-server communication service that will allow users on different computers to communicate. I'm planning to use a simple approach, with only capability to send and recieve messages. I'd like to work towards allowing users to communicate over different networks as an end goal.

There will be two programs that will need to be started in order to use the messaging system, the client and the server. These can be started from teh command line as normal.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

This network communication program is TCP based and uses a client/server configuration using port 55555. The messages are ASCII encoded.


# Development Environment

I used VScode and Python to develop this software, with the socket and threading library.
